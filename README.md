### About
My first native app using React Native displays a chat for mobile devices & will provide users with a chat interface, as well as options to share images and their location


### User stories
- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at anytime
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screenreader so that I can engage with a chat interface


### Features
- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button
- Communication features: sending images & location data
- Data gets stored online & offline

### How to run the project:

You can use any Emulator or Simulator to run the app on your device. To test this app, I have used Expo Go on iOS. To test the app with Expo, follow the below steps:

1) Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/halatinn97/Chatty.git

2) Install Expo CLI as a global npm package: npm install --global expo-cli

2) Install all dependecies: npm install

3) Start project: expo start / npx expo start

4) Launch the app on Expo
